# ThnoolBox
Have you ever wanted a collection of bodged desktop apps that are Lorax themed ? No ? Sucks to suck I guess

## Apps & their downsides
- [Thnoogle](src/Thnoogle), a web browser without SSL support
- [CalculaThneed](src/CalculaThneed), a calculator with an horrible colour theme
- [MineThneeder](src/MineThneeder), horrible name
